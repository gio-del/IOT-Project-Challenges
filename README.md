# IOT project and challenges

Grades: 30 cum laude/30

This repository contains the code and artifacts for the polimi IOT course project and challenges developed during the semester.

## Challenge 1

Tools used: Wireshark, Python

Challenge Goal: Extract meaningful insights from MQTT and CoAP communication using Python scripts and Wireshark capture analysis.

## Challenge 2

Tools used: Node-RED

Challenge Goal: Create a Node-RED flow for MQTT communication, including subscribing to a topic on a specific broker, filtering and extracting payload data, forwarding it to another MQTT topic on a different broker, visualizing the data on a graph, and exporting it to a CSV file.

## Challenge 3

Tools used: TinyOS, TOSSIM, Python

Challenge Goal: Develop a TinyOS application that implements a routing protocol for a wireless sensor network and validate its functionality using TOSSIM simulation.

## Project

Tools used: TinyOS, Cooja, Python, NODE-RED, ThingSpeak

Challenge Goal: Develop a TinyOS application that implements a publish-subscribe protocol for a wireless sensor network and validate its functionality using Cooja. The PAN Coordinator that acts as a broker sends the data to NODE-RED via TCP/IP. NODE-RED is used to filter and extract payload data, forward it to ThingSpeak, and visualize it on various graphs (Temperature, Humidity, Luminosity).
